# EmoDecode
We plan only release the code for DEFE+ dataset. The data processing and weight will be released upon the reception.
## Abstract
The human-machine interface (HMI) is a crucial aspect of the intelligent cockpit in intelligent vehicle systems, particularly in monitoring driver emotions. While discrete emotion models can provide an intuitive assessment of a driver's emotional category and intensity, recognizing facial emotions using these models is challenging. It requires distinguishing and correlating the classification and intensity recognition tasks, as well as identifying their unique spatio-temporal characteristics. The proposed EmoDecode model represents a significant advancement in this area, utilizing an uncertainty distillation mechanism and a dual-stream spatio-temporal masked Transformer to achieve optimal results for both tasks through collaborative training. Furthermore, regression is employed to address the problem of continuous intensity, which is later discretized using threshold processing. Experiment results on the DEFE+ and ISED datasets demonstrate that the proposed EmoDecode model outperforms existing methods in  driver facial emotion recognition. Our model shows potential in the early stages of HMI development to enhance driver experience and improve intelligent vehicle performance.
